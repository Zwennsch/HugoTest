this is for theme overrides

each theme comes with its own layouts folder. if you want to change your layout, you can override it either in the layouts folder of that specific theme
or you can copy the folders there into the layouts folder of your projects home directory.


to override stuff you have to copy the exact same folder structure from the theme you are using:
    here I created a _default/archives.html file in my root layouts just like in the PaperMod directory
