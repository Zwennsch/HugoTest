this is the folder where all your actual contents will be: posts, articles, pages, folders, subfolders....

if you want to add new content to your site:
    say you want to put something into your posts folder:
        hugo new posts/name_of_the_post.md

    seems like it is important to give it an md extension mor markdown

    this creates a new folder named posts into your content directory with a file named name_of_the_post.md

    the created file gets a set of headers:
    -----------
    title: "name_of_the_post"
    date: 2022-.....
    draft: false
    -----------

    when draft is set to true it is not going to be displayed, else it is.


    you can also create a new file/folder manually. But then you have to create the headers manually as well

    the "archives" stuff comes from : themes/PaperMod/layout/_default
